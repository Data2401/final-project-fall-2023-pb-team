## Introduction

[Student Behavior Data Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunapro/student-behavior/data)

This data from Kaggle was collected from various students through a survey. It aims to provide an understanding into student behavior and as current college students we wanted to learn more about what the data has to say about our typical behavior.

## Questions

-   What are the stress levels of students by gender?

-   Is there a relationship between social media usage and their stress level?

-   Do students with a low financial status tend to have higher stress levels?

-   Is there a relationship between the type of hobby a student has and their college mark?

-   Is there a relationship between students that like their degree and their willingness to pursue a career out of it?

-   What hobby is the most popular among students?

-   What gender tends to have higher academic marks?

-   Do students who perceive themselves to be in a low financial situation tend to have a part time job?
